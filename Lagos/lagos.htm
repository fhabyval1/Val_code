        <h2>History Of Lagos State:</h2>
      <p>
        Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria and the second most populous city in Africa, 
        with a population of 15.4 million as of 2015 within the city proper.
        Lagos, state, southwestern Nigeria, on the coast of the Bight of Benin. It is bounded by the state of Ogun to 
        the north and east, by the Bight of Benin to the south, and by the Republic of Benin to the west. From 1914 to 
        1954 the area included in the state was administered by the British as part of the colony of Nigeria. The provisions 
        of the 1954 constitution led to the creation of the Federal Territory of Lagos (the 27-square-mile [70-square-km] 
        area of Lagos Island, including the city of Lagos) and to the transfer of the city's hinterland to the administrative 
        region of Western Nigeria. This arrangement restricted the expansion of Lagos city onto the mainland, however, and in 
        1967 the creation of Lagos state by the national government restored to the city sovereignty over its hinterland.
        The state's mainly Yoruba population has grown more heterogeneous with the migration of other Nigerians and West Africans 
        to Lagos city.<br>

      </p>

          <h2>Agriculture:</h2>
      <p>
        Lagos state's agricultural and fishing output includes:
          <ul>
            <li>cassava (manioc)</li>
            <li>palm oil and kernels</li>
            <li>coconuts</li>
            <li>corn (maize)</li>
            <li>vegetables</li>
            <li>fruits</li>
            <li>fish</li>
          </ul>
        These products are collected in the lagoon ports of Badagry, Epe, and Ikorodu 
        and shipped to markets in Lagos city. Because of the limited space available on the three islands that constitute central 
        Lagos city, industry has been concentrated at estates both inside (Apapa, Ijora, and Yaba) and outside (Ikeja and Mushin) 
        the city, this made the central city increasingly become a commercial, financial, transportation, and service centre.<br>

      </p>

         <h2>Lagos Capital(Ikeja):</h2>
      <p>
        In response to the overcrowding and congestion of Lagos, the federal government selected a new capital site, Abuja, which 
        replaced Lagos as the national capital in December 1991. Lagos was the national capital of Nigeria until 
        December 1991 following the government's decision to move their capital to Abuja in the center of the country. The state government centred in Lagos city was shifted to Ikeja 
        in 1976.Ikeja is the capital city of Lagos State in southwestern Nigeria. Its population, as of the 2006 census, is 313,196. 
        Prior to the emergence of military rule in the early 1980s, Ikeja was a well planned, clean and quiet residential and commercial 
        town with shopping malls, pharmacies and government reservation areas. It lies 10.5 miles (17 km) northwest of Lagos city. 
    
          <ul>
            <li>The Murtala Muhammed International Airport</li> 
            <li>Femi Kuti's Africa Shrine for live music</li> 
            <li>Lagbaja's Motherland also for live music</li> 
            <li>Ikeja City Mall which is the largest mall on the Lagos State mainland(Shoprite)</li>
            <li>It's radio station broadcasting both in English (Eko FM) and in Yoruba (Radio Lagos)</li>
          </ul>

      </p> 
    
          <h2>Lagos Bridge:</h2>
      <p>
        Additional bridges and feeder roads have also been constructed from the central city to the mainland, and the 
        ports at Apapa and Tin Can Island have been incorporated into the metropolitan area to reduce harbour congestion.
        Lagos state is served by a main line of the Nigerian Railways (which has its central yards in Lagos city) and the trunk 
        highway system; Ikorodu, Mushin, and Ikeja are thereby linked to Lagos city. Epe, the state's other major town, is served 
        by secondary highways and is also a seaport. The three major bridges are:

          <ul>
            <li>Eko bridge</li>
            <li>Carter bridge</li>
            <li>Third Mainland Bridge</li>
          </ul>
        The bridge is referred to as Third Mainland Bridge because it is the third of the three bridges that connect Lagos Island with the 
        Mainland.<br>

        Lagos is a major African financial center and is the economic hub of Lagos State and Nigeria at large. The city has been described 
        as the cultural, financial, and entertainment capital of Africa. Lagos state is a significant influence on the following:

          <h2>Economy & Urbanisation:</h2>
      <p>
        Lagos is also among the top ten of the world's fastest-growing cities and urban areas. 
        The megacity has the fourth-highest GDP in Africa and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports 
        on the continent. The Lagos metropolitan area is a major educational and cultural centre in Sub Saharan Africa.[25] 
        Due to the large urban population and port traffic volumes, Lagos is classified as a Medium-Port Megacity.<br>

      </p>
   
         <h2>Lagos Island:</h2>
      <p>
        Lagos initially emerged as a home to the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba of West Africa and later emerged as a port city of the Benin 
        Empire that originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos 
        Island, Eti-Osa, Amuwo-Odofin and Apapa. The islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon, while 
        being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) 
        east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present 
        day Lagos Mainland, Ajeromi-Ifelodun, and Surulere. This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island, which 
        was the original city of Lagos, and the Mainland, which it has since expanded into. This city area was governed directly by the 
        Federal Government through the Lagos City Council, until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos 
        city into the present-day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the 
        then Western Region to form the state.<br>

      </p> 

          <h2>People & Population:</h2>
      <p>
        The state capital was later moved to Ikeja in 1976,[29] and the federal capital moved to Abuja in 1991. Even though Lagos is 
        still widely referred to as a city, the present-day Lagos, also known as "Metropolitan Lagos", and officially as "Lagos Metropolitan 
        Area" is an urban agglomeration or conurbation, consisting of 16 LGAs including Ikeja, the state capital of Lagos 
        State. This conurbation makes up 37% of Lagos State total land area, but houses about 85% of the state's total population.
        The exact population of Metropolitan Lagos is disputed.[36] In the 2006 federal census data, the conurbation had a 
        population of about 8 million people. However, the figure was disputed by the Lagos State Government, which later released its 
        own population data, putting the population of Lagos Metropolitan Area at approximately 16 million. Daily, the Lagos area 
        is growing by some 3,000 people or around 1.1 million annually, so the true population figure of the greater Lagos area in 2022 is 
        roughly 28 million (up from some 23.5 million in 2018). Lagos may therefore have overtaken Kinshasa as Africa's most populous city. 
        As of 2015, unofficial figures put the population of "Greater Metropolitan Lagos", which includes Lagos and its surrounding metro 
        area, extending as far as into Ogun State, at approximately 21 million.<br>

         <h2>Lagos Markets:</h2>
